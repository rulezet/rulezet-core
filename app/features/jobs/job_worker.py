"""
job_worker.py
Background threads that pick up pending jobs and execute them.

Start once at app startup:
    from app.features.jobs.job_worker import start_worker
    start_worker(app)

Two lanes, two threads, one shared BackgroundJob state machine:

- 'default' lane: everything except the job types in _BACKGROUND_LANE_TYPES
  below (GitHub sync, connector pulls, MISP/Velociraptor updates, quality
  score, bulk tagging, ...). Time-sensitive, expected to finish in seconds
  to minutes.
- 'background' lane: job types that are long-running and unattended by
  design (currently 'ai_generate' — the AI agents' bulk job type, see
  ~/Documents/Rulezet/IA-Integration-plan/AI_00_FOUNDATION.md §8). A
  single shared queue would mean one multi-day AI sweep over the rule
  catalog stalls every other job type for its entire duration, since a
  single worker thread claims one job and runs its handler synchronously
  to completion before looking at the next pending job. Splitting the
  queue by lane fixes that without touching the state machine, pause/
  cancel/resume plumbing, or any existing handler — both threads drive
  the same BackgroundJob rows through the same contract, they just pull
  from disjoint slices of the pending queue.
