activity_log.py — Fire-and-forget activity logging helper.

Usage:
    from app.core.utils.activity_log import log_activity

    log_activity("rule.create", f"Created rule '{rule.title}'",
                 target_type="rule", target_id=rule.id, target_uuid=rule.uuid)

`is_public`, `icon`, `title`, `category` and `level` are auto-determined
from the action if not provided. Never raises — failures are silently swallowed.
